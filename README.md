Multi-Step-Registration-Form:
• A modern multi-step React form with smooth slide transitions and clean login-style card UI, where each input sits in its own mini-box.
• Built-in validations prevent moving forward until required fields are filled, with inline error messages for better UX.
• A summary and review flow lets users edit their information or view a final receipt-style confirmation before submission.
User-Data-Dashboard:
• Visualize user data: The dashboard shows data through charts like bar, line, pie, and donut for quick insights.
• Interactive tables: Users can search, sort, filter by criteria (e.g., gender, country) and navigate with pagination.
• Organized views: Tabbed sections and dark/light mode make exploring demographics, engagement, and preferences easy and user-friendly.
